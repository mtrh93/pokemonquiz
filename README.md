# Pokemon Quiz

This is a basic quiz that asks 10 questions of the user.

The idea was inspired by by the Project example idea 2; build an online quiz. to select the pokemon theme I took inspiration from my enjoyment of the pokemon games. 

The quiz is purely designed to test general/specific knowledge relating to the earlier games from pokemon generations 1 to two. With the goal of providing a challenging quiz to entertain online users.

The project was created using HTML and CSS and JavaScript.

## Site Features

* **Navigation**

The page navigation is minimal. there is a welcome page as an intro, which leads into the main home page after animation. 
The home page is where the user is able to select a pokemon type which themes the quiz to their choice making the quiz more interactive. The home button uses javascript to refresh to this page.
There is an instruction page button which uses javascript to add a display; none class to relevant pages and reveals the instructions.
There is a quiz page once type is selcted where the main body of questions is asked and answered by the user.
The final page is a score page displaying what score the user got.


* **Welcome Page**
The opening welcome page is an homage to how most of the original pokemon games start with a black background and white text appearing and fading.
Animation in css was used to create this effect and relates the quiz from the beginnign to the chosen theme.
